Individuals who want to ensure that payments toward a credit account remain in good standing, in the event of disability or death, might benefit from credit insurance. For example, a situation when this might come up is for a mortgage on a primary family residence.

In most cases, however, personal loan insurance isn’t worth it. The extra costs can make your loan more expensive and put you at risk of default. Also, if you have life or disability insurance, it’s likely more affordable than investing in credit insurance.

Sometimes, however, personal loan insurance may make sense. If you have a loan that you can’t defer, for example, or you’re concerned about debt due to a medical condition, job loss, or death, it can be an option.
