If one of the events outlined in your credit policy takes place, such as death, disability, or involuntary unemployment, for instance, then a credit insurance policy will typically kick-in and pay all or some portion of your outstanding debt. Or it will make your monthly debt payments for a set period of time, depending on the circumstances that triggered the claim.

The money will be paid directly to the lender or creditor. This is what distinguishes credit insurance from other types of policies, such as life insurance, which makes payments to  designated individuals such as family members or yourself. While youâ€™re the one paying the premiums for credit insurance, the policy is designed to benefit lenders.
